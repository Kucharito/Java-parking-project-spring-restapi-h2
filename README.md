# üöó Java Spring Parking ‚Äì REST API

This project demonstrates a simple **Spring Boot REST API** for managing a parking garage system.  
It provides endpoints for creating and managing **parking spots, reservations, and check-in/check-out** processes.  
The application was created as part of a university project and serves as a demonstration of **CRUD operations** in a backend service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech stack
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.2 (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate)
- H2 in-memory database (with H2 console)
- Maven ‚Äì build & dependency management
- Lombok

üëâ This is the main project you need to open in IntelliJ IDEA or run with Maven (`mvn spring-boot:run`).  
üëâ A simple frontend (React/HTML) is **planned ‚Äì TODO**.
